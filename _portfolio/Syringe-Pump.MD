# Features

As an affordable alternative to expensive commercial programmable syringe pumps, this custom-built model combines 3D-printed and off-the-shelf parts into a fully functional syringe pump that is operable in laboratory settings for precise and gradual delivery of fluids. This model features an LED indicator light, an LCD screen that displays the flow rate, and a turn knob to adjust the flow rate. This syringe pump also features a slide-out drawer for easy access to internal components.

# Operating Procedure

1. Fill the syringe with liquid and insert into the holders. 
2. Fit the 20 mL syringe into the protruding back slot or the 10 mL syringe into the front slot. 
3. Make sure the ON/OFF button next to the LED light is pressed in, indicating an OFF stage. Plug in the power cord. The LED turns yellow. 
4. If a preset flow rate is desired, adjust the potentiometer such that it outputs “Flow Rate: 0” (completely turned to the left) or “Flow Rate: 100” (completely turned to the right). Then press the ON/OFF button to start the device at a consistent preset speed. 
5. If the potentiometer is required for operation, start with the knob turned completely to the left or the right (0 or 100 Flow Rate), press the ON/OFF button to start the device, and then adjust the knob to a desired flow rate such that the potentiometer is activated to control the speed of the motor. 
6. The LCD displays the flow rate and the time countdown. 
7. The LED turns green when the device is running, turns yellow when the flow rate is 0 and there’s liquid remaining in the syringe, and turns red when the device reaches the end of its operation.
