## **What is a microfluidic device?**

A microfluidic device is an innovative miniscule system designed to precisely manipulate small amount of fluids through microscale internal channels. By varying channel geometry, microfluidic devices can perform versatile tasks from mixing fluids and particle sorting to microscale reaction and detection. With its miniature size and precise control of fluid movement, microfluidic devices enable high material throughput with low reagent consumption, and has thus found its way into areas like biomedical & healthcare, biological research and environmental monitoring. This project aims to create a prototype microfluidic device from the ground up that utilizes *pinched flow fractionation* to efficiently separate microparticles based on size.

## **What is pinched flow fractionation?**

Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a simplistic but efficient design proposed by Yamada and coworkers in 2004 for the sized-base separation of particles suspended in a fluid. The key structure of PFF is a narrow pinch section where fluids with and without particles mix, followed by a broad section where the particles are separated. The two fluids are each introduced to the microfluidic chip through a channel, and directed to the pinch section. By controlling the flow rates of the two fluid streams, the particles are forced to align to one sidewall of the pinch section where the two streams intersect. At the end of the pinch section where the liquid flow starts to broaden, the differential force of the channel sidewall on particles of different sizes causes the particles' trajectory to slightly differentiate. Consequently, this slight positional difference is amplified by the broadening of the fluid in the broad section, effectively positions the particles at different locations in the laminar flow profile. Splitting the stream exiting the broad section based on particle position then allows particles of various sizes to be collected in separate streams.
