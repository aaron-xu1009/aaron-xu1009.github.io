## **What is a microfluidic device?**

A microfluidic device is an innovative miniscule system designed to precisely manipulate small amount of fluids through microscale internal channels. By varying channel geometry, 
microfluidic devices can perform versatile tasks from mixing fluids and particle sorting to microscale reaction and detection. With its miniature size and precise control of fluid 
movement, microfluidic devices enable high material throughput with low reagent consumption, and has thus found its way into areas like biomedical & healthcare, biological research 
and environmental monitoring. This project aims to create a prototype microfluidic device from the ground up that utilizes *pinched flow fractionation* to efficiently separate 
microparticles based on size.

## **What is pinched flow fractionation?**

Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a simplistic but efficient design for the sized-base separation of particles suspended in a fluid.
